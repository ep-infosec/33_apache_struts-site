# REST Plugin
{:.no_toc}

This plugin is only available with Struts 2.1.1 or later.

* Will be replaced with the ToC, excluding a header
{:toc}

## Overview

The REST Plugin provides high level support for the implementation of RESTful resource based web applications
[Convention Plugin](../convention).

If you prefer to see a working code example, instead of reading through an explanation, you can download 
the [Struts2 Example Applications](/download.cgi#struts-ga) and check out the `struts2-rest-showcase` application, 
a complete WAR file, that demonstrates a simple REST web program.

### Features

- Ruby on Rails REST-style URLs
- Zero XML config when used with Convention Plugin
- Built-in serialization and deserialization support for XML and JSON
- Automatic error handling
- Type-safe configuration of the HTTP response
- Automatic conditional GET support

### Mapping REST URLs to Struts 2 Actions

The main functionality of the REST plugin lies in the interpretation of incoming request URL's according the RESTful 
rules. In the Struts 2 framework, this `mapping` of request URL's to Actions is handled by in implementation of 
the [ActionMapper](/maven/struts2-core/apidocs/org/apache/struts2/dispatcher/mapper/ActionMapper) interface. 
Out of the box, Struts 2 uses the [DefaultActionMapper](/maven/struts2-core/apidocs/org/apache/struts2/dispatcher/mapper/DefaultActionMapper) 
to map URL's to Actions via the logic you are probably already familiar with.

### Actions or Controllers ?

Most Struts 2 developers are familiar with the Action. They are the things that get executed by the incoming requests. 
In the context of the REST plugin, just to keep you on your toes, we'll adopt the RESTful lingo and refer to our 
Actions as **Controllers**. Don't be confused; it's just a name!

The REST plugin provides an alternative implementation, [RestActionMapper](/maven/struts2-plugins/struts2-rest-plugin/apidocs/org/apache/struts2/rest/RestActionMapper), 
that provides the RESTful logic that maps a URL to a give action class ( aka `controller` in RESTful terms ) and, 
more specifically, to the invocation of a method on that controller class. The following section, which comes from 
the Javadoc for the class, details this logic.

### RESTful URL Mapping Logic

This Restful action mapper enforces Ruby-On-Rails REST-style mappings. If the method is not specified (via `!` 
or `method:` prefix), the method is "guessed" at using REST-style conventions that examine the URL and the HTTP method. 
Special care has been given to ensure this mapper works correctly with the Convention plugin so that XML configuration 
is unnecessary.

This mapper supports the following parameters:

- `struts.mapper.idParameterName` - If set, this value will be the name  of the parameter under which the id is stored. 
  The id will then be removed  from the action name. Whether the method is specified, the mapper will try 
  to truncate the identifier from the url and store it as a parameter.
- `struts.mapper.indexMethodName`  - The method name to call for a GET  request with no id parameter. Defaults to **index**.
- `struts.mapper.getMethodName`  - The method name to call for a GET  request with an id parameter. Defaults to **show**.
- `struts.mapper.postMethodName`  - The method name to call for a POST  request with no id parameter. Defaults to **create**.
- `struts.mapper.putMethodName`  - The method name to call for a PUT  request with an id parameter. Defaults to **update**.
- `struts.mapper.deleteMethodName`  - The method name to call for a DELETE  request with an id parameter. Defaults to **destroy**.
- `struts.mapper.editMethodName`  - The method name to call for a GET  request with an id parameter and the **edit** view specified. Defaults to **edit**.
- `struts.mapper.newMethodName`  - The method name to call for a GET  request with no id parameter and the **new** view specified. Defaults to **editNew**.

The following URL's will invoke its methods:

- `GET: /movies` => method=**index**
- `GET: /movies/Thrillers` => method=**show**, id=**Thrillers**
- `GET: /movies/Thrillers;edit`  => method=**edit**, id=**Thrillers**
- `GET: /movies/Thrillers/edit`  => method=**edit**, id=**Thrillers**
- `GET: /movies/new`  => method=**editNew**
- `POST: /movies`  => method=**create**
- `PUT: /movies/Thrillers`  => method=**update**, id=**Thrillers**
- `DELETE: /movies/Thrillers`  => method=**destroy**, id=**Thrillers**

To simulate the HTTP methods PUT and DELETE, since they aren't supported by HTML, the HTTP parameter `_method` will be used.

Or, expressed as a table:

|HTTP method|URI                     |Class.method |parameters    
|-----------|------------------------|-------------|--------------
|GET        |/movie|Movie.index      |             |              
|POST       |/movie|Movie.create     |             |              
|PUT        |/movie/Thrillers        |Movie.update |id="Thrillers"
|DELETE     |/movie/Thrillers        |Movie.destroy|id="Thrillers"
|GET        |/movie/Thrillers        |Movie.show   |id="Thrillers"
|GET        |/movie/Thrillers/edit   |Movie.edit   |id="Thrillers"
|GET        |/movie/new|Movie.editNew|             |              

### Content Types

In addition to providing mapping of RESTful URL's to Controller ( Action ) invocations, the REST plugin also provides 
the ability to produce multiple representations of the resource data. By default, the plugin can return the resource 
in the following content types:

- HTML
- XML 
- JSON

There is nothing configure here, just add the content type extension to your RESTful URL. The framework will take care 
of the rest. So, for instance, assuming a Controller called Movies and a movie with the id of superman, the following 
URL's will all hit the

```text
http://my.company.com/myapp/movies/superman
http://my.company.com/myapp/movies/superman.xml
http://my.company.com/myapp/movies/superman.xhtml
http://my.company.com/myapp/movies/superman.json
```

> Note, these content types are supported as incoming data types as well. And, if you need, you can extend 
> the functionality by writing your own implementations of org.apache.struts2.rest.handler.ContentTypeHandler 
> and registering them with the system.

## Usage

This section will walk you through a quick demo. Here are the steps in the sequence that we will follow.

- Setting Up your Project
- Configuring your Project
- Writing your Controllers

### Setting Up

Assuming you have a normal Struts 2 application, all you need to do for this REST demo is to add the following two plugins:

- Struts 2 Rest Plugin
- [Struts 2 Convention Plugin](../convention)

> Note, you can download the jars for these plugins from [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cstruts2-convention-plugin)

### Configuration - struts.xml

Just dropping the plugin's into your application may not produce exactly the desired effect. There are a couple of considerations. 
The first consideration is whether you want to have any non-RESTful URL's coexisting with your RESTful URL's. We'll 
show two configurations. The first assumes all you want to do is REST. The second assumes you want to keep other 
non-RESTful URL's alive in the same Struts 2 application.

As with all configuration of Struts 2, we prefer using `<constant/>` elements in our `struts.xml`.

### REST Only Configuration

Instruct Struts to use the REST action mapper:

```xml
<constant name="struts.mapper.class" value="rest" />
```

At this point, the REST mapper has replaced the DefaultActionMapper so all incoming URL's will be interpreted as RESTful URL's.

We're relying on the Convention plugin to find our controllers, so we need to configure the convention plugin a bit:

```xml
<constant name="struts.convention.action.suffix" value="Controller"/>
<constant name="struts.convention.action.mapAllMatches" value="true"/>
<constant name="struts.convention.default.parent.package" value="rest-default"/>
<constant name="struts.convention.package.locators" value="example"/>
```

> Note, you don't have to use the Convention plugin just to use the REST plugin. The actions of your RESTful application 
> can be defined in XML just as easily as by convention. The REST mapper doesn't care how the application came to know 
> about your actions when it maps a URL to an invocation of one of it's methods.

### REST and non-RESTful URL's Together Configuration

If you want to keep using some non-RESTful URL's alongside your REST stuff, then you'll have to provide 
for a configuration that utilizes to mappers.

Plugins contain their own configuration. If you look in the Rest plugin jar, you'll see the struts-plugin.xml and in that 
you'll see some configuration settings made by the plugin. Often, the plugin just sets things the way it wants them. 
You may frequently need to override those settings in your own struts.xml.

First, you'll need to re-assert the extensions that struts knows about because the rest plugin will have thrown out 
the default `action` extension.

```xml
  <constant name="struts.action.extension" value="xhtml,,xml,json,action"/>
```

Next, we will configure the [PrefixBasedActionMapper](../../core-developers/action-mapper.html#prefixbasedactionmapper), 
which is part of the core Struts 2 distribution, to have some URL's routed to the Rest mapper and others to the default mapper.

```xml
  <constant name="struts.mapper.class" value="org.apache.struts2.dispatcher.mapper.PrefixBasedActionMapper" />
  <constant name="struts.mapper.prefixMapping" value="/rest:rest,:struts"/>
  <constant name="struts.actionProxyFactory" value="prefix"/>
```

> Please be aware that you should also use the `PrefixBasedActionProxyFactory` factory together with the `PrefixBasedActionMapper` 
> mapper to allow the framework to create proper `ActionProxy`s per given prefix. 

And, again, we're relying on the Convention plugin to find our controllers, so we need to configure the convention plugin a bit:

```xml
<constant name="struts.convention.action.suffix" value="Controller"/>
<constant name="struts.convention.action.mapAllMatches" value="true"/>
<constant name="struts.convention.default.parent.package" value="rest-default"/>
<constant name="struts.convention.package.locators" value="example"/>
```

### Write Your Controller Actions

Once everything is configured, you need to create the controllers. Controllers are simply actions created with 
the purpose of handling requests for a give RESTful resource. As we saw in the mapping logic above, various REST URL's 
will hit different methods on the controller. Traditionally, normal Struts 2 actions expose the `execute` method as their 
target method. Here's a sample controller for a `orders` resource. Note, this sample doesn't implement all of the methods 
that can be hit via the RESTful action mapper's interpretation of URL's.

```java
package org.apache.struts2.rest.example;

public class OrdersController implements ModelDriven<Order> {

    private OrderManager orderManager;
    private String id;
    private Order model;

    // Handles /orders/{id} GET requests
    public HttpHeaders show() {
        model = orderManager.findOrder(id);
        return new DefaultHttpHeaders("show")
            .withETag(model.getUniqueStamp())
            .lastModified(model.getLastModified());
    }

    // Handles /orders/{id} PUT requests
    public String update() {
        orderManager.updateOrder(model);
        return "update";
    }

    // getters and setters
}
```

In this example, the `ModelDriven` interface is used to ensure that only my model, the Order object in this case, is 
returned to the client, otherwise, the whole `OrdersController` object would be serialized.

Where's ActionSupport? Normally, you extend ActionSupport when writing Struts 2 actions. In these case, our controller 
doesn't do that. Why, you ask? ActionSupport provides a bunch of important functionality to our actions, including support 
for i18n and validation. All of this functionality, in the RESTful case, is provided by the default interceptor stack 
defined in the REST plugin's struts-plugin.xml file. Unless you willfully break your controller's membership 
in the rest-default package in which that stack is defined, then you'll get all that functionality you are used 
to inheriting from ActionSupport.

You may wonder why the `show()` method returns a `HttpHeaders` object and the `update()` method returns the expected 
result code String. The REST Plugin adds support for action methods that return `HttpHeaders` objects as a way for 
the action to have more control over the response. In this example, we wanted to ensure the response included the ETag 
header and a last modified date so that the information will be cached properly by the client. The `HttpHeaders` object 
is a convenient way to control the response in a type-safe way.

Also, notice we aren't returning the usual "success" result code in either method. This allows us to use the special 
features of the [Conventio Plugin](../convention) to intuitively select the result template to process when this 
resource is accessed with the `.xhtml` extension. In this case, we can provide a customized XHTML view of the resource 
by creating `/orders-show.jsp` and `/orders-update.jsp` for the respective methods.

## Advanced Topics

The following sections describe some non-standard bells and whistles that you might need to utilize for your 
application's more non-standard requirements.
       
### XStream configuration

Since Struts 6.1.0 you can customise XStream handler by implementing a few interfaces:
- `XStreamAllowedClasses` - to control which classes can be accessed by the XStream
- `XStreamAllowedClassNames` - similar to the above but you can specify class names
- `XStreamPermissionProvider` - you can define a custom set of `TypePermission`s used by XStream
- `XStreamProvider` - you can create your own instance of `XStream` which will be used to serialise/deserialize objects

These interfaces need to be implemented by an action:

```java
private static class SimpleAction extends ActionSupport implements XStreamProvider {
    @Override
    public XStream createXStream() {
        XStream stream = new XStream(new StaxDriver());
        stream.alias("parents", ArrayList.class);
        stream.alias("data", SimpleBean.class);
        return stream;
    }
}
```
                                                                                      
### Custom ContentTypeHandlers

If you need to handle extensions that aren't supported by the default handlers, you can create your own `ContentTypeHandler` 
implementation and define it in your `struts.xml`:

```xml
<bean name="yaml" type="org.apache.struts2.rest.handler.ContentTypeHandler" class="com.mycompany.MyYamlContentHandler" />
```

If the built-in content type handlers don't do what you need, you can override the handling of any extension by providing 
an alternate handler. First, define your own `ContentTypeHandler` and declare with its own alias. For example:

```xml
<bean name="myXml" type="org.apache.struts2.rest.handler.ContentTypeHandler" class="com.mycompany.MyXmlContentHandler" />
```

Then, tell the REST Plugin to override the handler for the desired extension with yours. In `struts.properties`, it would 
look like this:

```xml
<constant name="struts.rest.handlerOverride.xml" value="myXml"/>
```

### Settings

The following settings can be customized. See the [developer guide](/core-developers/configuration-files).
For more configuration options see the [Convention Plugin Documentation](../convention)
