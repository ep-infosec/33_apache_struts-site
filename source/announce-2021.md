#### 12 December 2021 - Security Advice on Log4j 2.15.0 {#a20211212-2}

The Apache Struts Security team would like to announce that all the users using the latest Struts 2.5.x series 
should upgrade [Log4j](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/) library to the  latest **2.15.0** version which addresses 
the Remote-Code-Execution vulnerability **CVE-2021-44228**. 

This version of Log4j requires Java 8, while Apache Struts 2.5.x series is still using Java 1.7 and because
of that we cannot prepare a new patched 2.5.x version. Yet, in most cases this is a drop-in upgrade as Log4j 2.15.0 
maintains binary compatibility with previous releases - once you are running on Java 8. In case you are not able 
to upgrade Log4j, please use one of  the described mitigations.

More information can be found [here](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/#News).

**All developers are strongly advised to perform this action.**
