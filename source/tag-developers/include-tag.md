# include

Please make sure you have read the [Tag Syntax](tag-syntax) document and understand how tag attribute syntax works.

## Description

{% remote_file_content https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/struts/master/core/src/site/resources/tags/include-description.html %}

> **Note:** Any additional params supplied to the included page are **not** accessible within the rendered page 
> through the `<s:property.../>` tag since no ValueStack will be created. You can, however, access them in a servlet
> via the HttpServletRequest object or from a JSP page via a scriptlet.

**How To access parameters**

Parameters are passed as request parameters, so use the `${param.ParamName}` notation to access them. Do not use 
the **property** tag to access parameters in included files.
