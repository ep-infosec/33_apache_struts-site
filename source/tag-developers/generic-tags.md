# Generic Tags

Generic tags are used for controlling the execution flow when the pages render. These tags also allow for data extraction 
from places other than your action or the value stack, such as _Localization_ , JavaBeans, and including additional URLs 
or action executions.

- Control Tags provide control flow, such as `if`, `else`, and `iterator`
- Data Tags allow for data manipulation or creation, such as `bean`, `push`, and `i18n`
