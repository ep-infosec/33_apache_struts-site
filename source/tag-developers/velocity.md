# Velocity

Velocity is a templating language for Java.

For more information on Velocity itself, please visit the [Velocity website](http://velocity.apache.org/).

> Velocity is similar to [FreeMarker](freemarker), as both are template languages that can be used outside 
> of a Servlet container. The framework uses FreeMarker internally since it has better error reporting. 
> Developers may also like that FreeMarker supports JSP taglibs. However, both are good alternatives to JSP.

> NOTE: Since Struts 6.0.0 support for Velocity has been moved into [a dedicated plugin](../plugins/velocity/),
> you must include the plugin in your pom.xml to use Velocity in your application.

## Getting Started

Getting started with Velocity is as simple as ensuring all the dependencies are included in your project's classpath. 
Other than that, `struts-default.xml`  already configures the [Velocity Result](../core-developers/velocity-result).

**struts.xml**

```xml
<action name="test" class="com.acme.TestAction">
    <result name="success" type="velocity">test-success.vm</result>
</action>
```

**test-success.vm**

```html
<html>
<head>
    <title>Hello</title>
</head>
    <body>
    Hello, ${name}
    </body>
</html>
```

Where `name` is a property on the Action class. That's it!

There are few more details of interest, such as how templates are loaded and variables are resolved.

## Template Loading

The framework looks for Velocity templates in two locations (in this order):

1. Web application

2. Class path

The ordering is designed so that a default set of templates can be placed in a JAR (perhaps shared between applications).
If a template needs to be overridden, a different version can be placed in the web application.

Unlike JSPs, templates can be loaded from a JAR. Templates are a great way to support "plugins", since the entire 
module can be delivered in a single JAR, and the views easily customized by the host application.

## Variable Resolution

In Velocity, there are three sources for variables, searched in a specific order.

1. The value stack

2. The action context

3. Built-in variables

Since the action context is resolved after the value stack, you can reference the variable without the typical preceding 
marker (`#`) that has to be used with the JSP `s:property` tag. Omitting the marker can be convenient, but it can also 
trip you up, if used carelessly.

```
#surl "id=url" "value=http://www.yahoo.com"
Click <a href="${url}">here</a>!
```

The Stuts2-Velocity integration layer provides several implicit variables.

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| stack | The value stack itself, useful for calls like \${stack.findString('ognl expr')} |
| action | The action most recently executed |
| response | The HttpServletResponse |
| res | Same as response |
| request | The HttpServletRequest |
| req | Same as request |
| session | The HttpSession |
| application | The ServletContext |
| base | The request's context path |

## Configuring Velocity

You can configure Velocity by placing configuration items in [velocity.properties](../core-developers/velocity-properties).
