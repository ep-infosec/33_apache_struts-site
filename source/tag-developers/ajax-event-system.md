# ajax event system

> NOTE: Ajax template (Dojo plugin) is deprecated and won't be supported any longer.

As you may have seen with the [ajax div template](ajax-div-template) and [ajax a template](ajax-a-template), 
the framework and Dojo provide a nice way to subscribe and notify of topics from within the browser. A benefit of using 
Dojo as the basis of many of these components is being able to loosely couple UI components. There are two 
attributes of importance: `listenTopics` and `notifyTopics`.

- If a component has a `notifyTopics` attribute, then after the processing has been completed a message with be published 
  to the topic names supplied as a value (comma delimited).
- If a component has a `listenTopics` attribute, then when a message is published to the topic names supplied as a value 
  (comma delimited), the component will perform custom tag-specific logic ( i.e a DIV tag will re-fresh its content).

As well as this, you can publish and subscribe to topic names with javascript code. To publish to the `topic_name` topic:

```java
dojo.event.topic.publish("topic_name", "content");
```

The `topic_name` attribute is required, the content attribute is not and most elements are triggered without having this 
attribute. See the [ajax div template](ajax-div-template) for an example of this type of interaction.

To subscribe to the `topic_name` topic:

```javascript
function doSomethingWithEvent(data) {
...
}

dojo.event.topic.getTopic("topic_name").subscribe(null, "doSomethingWithEvent");
```

The `subscribe` method takes 2 parameters, the first is the JavaScript object variable (or null if the function is not 
from an object) and the second is the name of the function to call when an event is received on the topic.
