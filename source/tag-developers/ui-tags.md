# UI Tags

Unlike _generic tags_, UI tags do not provide much control structure or logic. Rather, they are focused on using data, 
either from your action/value stack or from the Data Tags, and displaying data in rich and reusable HTML. All UI tags 
are driven by _templates_  and _themes_ . While generic tags simply output some content directly from the tag (if there 
is any content to output), the UI tags defer to a template, often grouped together as a theme, to do the actual rendering.

Template support allows UI tags to build a rich set of reusable HTML components that can be customized to fit exact 
requirements. For details, see [Themes and Templates](themes-and-templates).

|[Themes and Templates](themes-and-templates)| A must-read explanation of how themes and templates are used when rendering UI tags. |
|[Form Tags](form-tags)| provide all form-related UI output, such as _form_ , _textfield_ , and _select_ . |
| Non Form Tags | provide all non-form-related UI output, such as _a_ , _div_ , and _tabbedPanel_ . |

## Language Specific Tag Support

The framework strives to support multiple development environments. The framework does not impose a single template language. 
Almost any common language can be used, and there are hooks for new languages. By default, almost every single tag is 
supported in JSP, Velocity, and FreeMarker. In each of these sections, you'll find examples and techniques for applying 
the generic tag reference toward your specific language or template choice.

- [JSP Tags](jsp-tags)
- [Velocity Tags](velocity-tags)
- [FreeMarker Tags](freemarker-tags)

Please make sure you have read the [Tag Syntax](tag-syntax) document and understand how tag attribute syntax works.

Within the form tags, there are two classes of tags: the form tag itself, and all other tags, which make up the individual 
form elements. The behavior of the form tag is different than the elements enclosed within it.
