## WebSphere 6\.5

To make struts2 work in Websphere, one has to set Websphere specific properties, you may want to add that to the wiki:

The properties are:


~~~~~~~

com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.assumefiltersuccessonsecurityerror = true
com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.invokefilterscompatibility = true

~~~~~~~

At least that is necessary when using StrutsPrepareAndExecuteFilter\.

In Websphre admin console one has to add those properties here:


~~~~~~~

Servers > Application servers > {server name} > Web container > Custom Properties

~~~~~~~

A wsadmin jython script to set those properties could look like this:


~~~~~~~


def findObjectName(objectId):
        index = objectId.find('(')
        return objectId[0 : index]

node = AdminNodeManagement.listNodes()[0]
server = AdminConfig.list('Server')

nodeName = findObjectName(node)
serverName = findObjectName(server)

webContainer = AdminConfig.list('WebContainer', node)
webContainerDetails = AdminConfig.show(webContainer)

if webContainerDetails.find("com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.assumefiltersuccessonsecurityerror") == -1:
        print "creating prop: com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.assumefiltersuccessonsecurityerror"
        AdminServerManagement.configureCustomProperty(nodeName, serverName, "WebContainer","com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.assumefiltersuccessonsecurityerror", "true")
if webContainerDetails.find("com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.invokefilterscompatibility") == -1:
        print "creating prop: com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.invokefilterscompatibility"
        AdminServerManagement.configureCustomProperty(nodeName, serverName, "WebContainer", "com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.invokefilterscompatibility", "true")

~~~~~~~

## JSESSIONID handling

IBM WebSphere Application Server uses the JSESSIONID information to keep track of the client session\. If you have an application where the application client must navigate across multiple WebSphere Application Server nodes residing in same domain, then the JSESSIONID information may be over\-written on the client because multiple JSESSIONID cookies received with the same name and path\.

When persistence is disabled and if the JSESSIONID in the incoming request is not found in the current session manager, then the session manager will generate a new sessionId and create a session object, instead of using the sessionId in the incoming request\.

To resolve this issue, configure WebSphere Application Server to reuse the sessionId present in the incoming request\.

For All versions:

1. Open the administrative console.

2. Select Servers > Application Servers > Server_Name > Server Infrastructure > Java and Process Management > Process Definition > Java Virtual Machine > Custom Properties > New

3. Add a new Custom Property for the JVM to reuse the sessionId:


~~~~~~~

System Property Name: HttpSessionIdReuse
System Property Value: true

~~~~~~~

4. Save your changes and restart the Application Server.

If the application client does not navigate across multiple WebSphere Application Server nodes residing in the same domain but there are multiple WARs with different context roots, following is the step that needs to be followed for session to be maintained in one web application:

1. Open the administrative console.

2. Select Application servers > Server_Name > Session management > Cookies

3. In "Cookie Path", specify the context root of web application in which session needs to be maintained. This will ensure that cookies are sent only to /<<context_root>> URL and prevent overriding of JSSESSIONID cookie which results in new session creation by WAS.

4. Save your changes and restart the Application Server.

##Big Picture## {#PAGE_13859}

The diagram describes the framework's architecture\.

![Struts2\-Architecture\.png](/Users/lukaszlenart/Projects/Apache/struts\-site/target/md/attachments/att2475\_Struts2\-Architecture\.png)

In the diagram, an initial request goes to the Servlet container (such as Jetty or Resin) which is passed through a standard filter chain\. The chain includes the (optional) **ActionContextCleanUp** filter, which is useful when integrating technologies such as _SiteMesh Plugin_ \. Next, the required **FilterDispatcher** is called, which in turn consults the [ActionMapper](#PAGE_14128) to determine if the request should invoke an action\.

If the ActionMapper determines that an Action should be invoked, the FilterDispatcher delegates control to the **ActionProxy**\. The ActionProxy consults the framework [Configuration Files](#PAGE_14163) manager (initialized from the [struts\.xml](#PAGE_13901) file)\. Next, the ActionProxy creates an **ActionInvocation**, which is responsible for the command pattern implementation\. This includes invoking any **Interceptors** (the _before_  clause) in advance of invoking the **Action** itself\.

Once the Action returns, the ActionInvocation is responsible for looking up the proper **result** associated with the **Action result code** mapped in `struts.xml`\. The result is then executed, which often (but not always, as is the case for [Action Chaining](#PAGE_14214)) involves a template written in _JSP_  or _FreeMarker_  to be rendered\. While rendering, the templates can use the _Struts Tags_  provided by the framework\. Some of those components will work with the ActionMapper to render proper URLs for additional requests\.



| All objects in this architecture (Actions, [Results](#PAGE_14035), [Interceptors](#PAGE_13941), and so forth) are created by an [ObjectFactory](#PAGE_27470)\. This ObjectFactory is pluggable\. We can provide our own ObjectFactory for any reason that requires knowing when objects in the framework are created\. A popular ObjectFactory implementation uses Spring as provided by the _Spring Plugin_ \.

| 

Interceptors are executed again (in reverse order, calling the _after_  clause)\. Finally, the response returns through the filters configured in the `web.xml`\. If the ActionContextCleanUp filter is present, the FilterDispatcher will _not_  clean up the ThreadLocal **ActionContext**\. If the ActionContextCleanUp filter is not present, the FilterDispatcher will cleanup all ThreadLocals\.
