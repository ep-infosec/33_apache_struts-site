# Multiselect Interceptor

Multiselect Interceptor is defined in the `defaultStack`. It checks each form parameter submitted to the action and if 
it finds one with a prefix of `__multiselect_` it inserts a value for a parameter whose name is derived from the suffix
to `__multiselect_` if it does not exist. The default value inserted is an empty String array.

This means that a a field that can have multiple selected values(select, checkboxlist, etc) can be accompanied by a hidden 
input with the same name but a prefix of `__multiselect_` so that if the no value is selected on the form the action 
will still receive a value(empty collection) rather than the default HTML action of not providing a value for unselected 
elements.
