# struts.xml

The core configuration file for the framework is the default (`struts.xml`) file and should reside on the classpath 
of the webapp (generally `/WEB-INF/classes`).

- The default file may include other configuration files as needed.
- A `struts-plugin.xml` file can be placed in a JAR and automatically plugged into an application, so that modules 
  can be self-contained and automatically configured.
- In the case of Freemarker and Velocity modules, the templates can also be loaded from the classpath, so the entire 
  module can be plugged in as a single JAR.
