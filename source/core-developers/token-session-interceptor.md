# Token Session Interceptor

This interceptor builds off of the [Token Interceptor](token-interceptor), providing advanced logic for handling 
invalid tokens. Unlike the normal token interceptor, this interceptor will attempt to provide intelligent fail-over 
in the event of multiple requests using the same session. That is, it will block subsequent requests until the first 
request is complete, and then instead of returning the <i>invalid.token</i> code, it will attempt to display the same 
response that the original, valid action invocation would have displayed if no multiple requests were submitted 
in the first place.

> NOTE: As this method extends off MethodFilterInterceptor, it is capable of deciding if it is applicable only 
> to selective methods in the action class. See `MethodFilterInterceptor` for more info.
